podcastjs is a Knowledgebase platform for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that uses static
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files to power the knowledgebase.

podcastjs can be called a "static site generator" of sorts as it doesn't require a database. All
of your content is stored in the `content` folder in Markdown (`.md`) files and the entire
knowledgebase structure and content is generated by podcastjs. This is good because it's:

* **Simple:** You can create and manage an entire knowledge base using your favorite text editor
* **Flat:** podcastjs is a "flat file" CMS, meaning no database woe's, no MySQL queries, nothing
* **Fast:** podcastjs is seriously lightweight and doesn't use a database, making it super fast

podcastjs features:

* Responsive default template (powered by [bootstrap-simple-admin-template](https://github.com/alexis-luna/bootstrap-simple-admin-template))
* Full-text search powered by [LokiJS](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS)

technologies:

* nodejs
* [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) for easy templating
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
* [nodeboot-web-security-starter](https://github.com/jrichardsz-software-architect-tools/nodeboot-web-security-starter)
